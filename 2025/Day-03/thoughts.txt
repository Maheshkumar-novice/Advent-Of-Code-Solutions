we have a batteries ordered in a battery pack rows.
on each row we can turn on only 2 batteries. order matters.
by concating the turned on batteries joltage we can find the total joltage of the pack.
we can't switch the order.

if we have something like this, then my thought,

first find the id of the maximum value. in the example case it is 9.

and the next value should be from the remaining elements. so for the remaining elements we do the same process.
find the max element.

if the first max element is at the end, then find the largest from the first till max index element.

reverse the result.

if the max is at first then no problem.

have a util for finding max element and their index from a list.

send the whole list.
if the max is at the end
    then send the first till max index list and find max.
    reverse the result and use it

else
    send the max till end list and find max concat and use.
