Let me break down why the NumPy approach is particularly efficient for this grid manipulation problem:

1. **Memory Layout**
- NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, unlike Python nested lists which store references to objects
- With `dtype=bool`, each cell only takes 1 byte of memory, compared to Python's bool objects which have more overhead
- This makes memory access patterns much more cache-friendly

2. **Vectorized Operations**
The original code:
```python
for i in range(int(x_start), int(x_end) + 1):
    for j in range(int(y_start), int(y_end) + 1):
        if instruction == "toggle":
            grid[i][j] = not grid[i][j]
```

The NumPy code:
```python
region = np.s_[x1:x2+1, y1:y2+1]
grid[region] = ~grid[region]  # for toggle
```

Key differences:
- The nested Python loops operate one cell at a time, requiring Python-level interpretation overhead for each operation
- NumPy's slice operations are implemented in C and operate on entire memory blocks at once
- The `~` operator for boolean arrays is highly optimized in NumPy, performing bitwise operations at the C level

3. **Views vs Copies**
```python
region = np.s_[x1:x2+1, y1:y2+1]  # Creates a view
```
- Using `np.s_[]` creates a view (memory reference) rather than copying data
- When we modify the region, we're directly modifying the original array's memory
- No temporary arrays are created for these operations

4. **Array Broadcasting**
- NumPy's broadcasting allows operations between arrays of different shapes to be performed efficiently
- In our case, assigning True/False to an entire region is optimized under the hood

This might be clearer with a small benchmark:

```python
# Python list approach (simplified)
def python_toggle(grid, x1, x2, y1, y2):
    for i in range(x1, x2+1):
        for j in range(y1, y2+1):
            grid[i][j] = not grid[i][j]

# NumPy approach
def numpy_toggle(grid, x1, x2, y1, y2):
    grid[x1:x2+1, y1:y2+1] = ~grid[x1:x2+1, y1:y2+1]

# For a 1000x1000 grid, toggling a 100x100 region:
# Python version: ~10ms
# NumPy version: ~0.1ms
```

The performance difference becomes even more dramatic as:
1. Grid size increases
2. Number of operations increases
3. Size of regions being modified increases
